# Biological Relationships

**Problems/Limitations:** More work would be needed to include the biology of exceptional groups such as Scolytinae/Platypodinae/Cossoninae, pollination, interactions with fungi/other animals, or the biology of those species that are saproxylic. In saproxylic species, the problem would be that the identity of the "host" is often unclear, the biology of those weevils cannot easily be understood as a biological relationship between two species, its more a biological relationship between a weevil and a micro-habitat.

**To do:** Add Properties for "asserted" and "direct evidence" to have a clearer separation between statements that are assertive vs reports that are backed by an observation. Also a separation between statements about whole species vs statements about single observation would make sense.

## Preface

### Biological Relationship vs Biological Association?

In TaxonWorks, **Biological Relationships are definitions of biological interaction** that can take place between two objects. In the context of TaxonWorks, Biological Relationships provide a name for the relationship, and may also define properties that further classify the object on each side of the relationship.

**Biological associations** are instances that utilize BiologicalRelationship:

- Biological associations involve the BiologicalRelationship plus **any two** of **1)** species (OTU), **2)** "specimens" (FieldOccurrence or CollectionObject) or **3)** AnatomicalParts (life stage or body part, e.g. "`larva of Adosomus`). So for example you could have a `CollectionObject of Adosomus roridus` that was `reared from` an AnatomicalPart `stem of Achillea`".
- They can be further annotated e.g. with an asserted distribution or images.

#### Example

Masur & Wartmann (2025) reported from Baden-Württemberg that they observed larvae of *Adosomus roridus* feeding in the roots of *Achillea millefolium*.

This can be modeled as a biological association between *Adosomus roridus* and *Achillea millefolium*, where:

- *Adosomus roridus* participates in the interaction as the AnatomicalPart [larva], with the BiologicalRelationship [consumer in a trophic relationship].
- *Achillea millefolium* participates in the interaction as AnatomicalPart [root]
- The interaction between both was observed in a locality (can be modeled as AssertedDistrution Baden-Württemberg, alternatively using CollectionObject or FieldOccurrence with a  or a more precise place)
- The whole of the data has a citation: Masur & Wartmann (2005)

All of these aspects can be represented in TaxonWorks. The properties may appear redundant in some cases, but they are important as they assure semantic meaning and allow to filter the dataset. Another relationship can be defined for adult feeding of the weevils on their host plant, which was also reported in the same paper.

In TaxonWorks, the relationship (= e.g. larva feeding in roots of) cannot be composed dynamically by mixing a custom range of properties for each particular instance (= e.g. larva of *Adosomus* on *Achillea*) of the relationship. Instead, a **relationship** is defined once for reuse across many interaction instances, with fixed participant role properties.

## Theory

- Our knowledge about the biology of weevils is limited and will always stay limited.
- Therefore, any attempt to catalog weevil-hostplant interactions should focus on capturing information on published statements or direct observations: Rather than trying to capture biological reality itself, we have to focus on *what was actually observed*, ("a specimen was reared from a seedpod of plant xy at place xy, according to source xy") rather than "the species is developing in seed pods of plant xy")

### Scope: What kind of information do we want to store?

- When putting data into a structured format, some information is always lost. But the database will also be **an index to literature** and other evidence. Not all details are captured within TaxonWorks, but the original source can always be consulted for a more detailed, but only human-readable description.
- We need to be able to extract the most relevant information from the dataset.
    - Asserted statements from literature (sometimes not directly backed by evidence). Asserted statements from literature can have a lot of detail, or they just link the taxon names of the two species.
    - Direct observation (either from literature or from field occurrence/collection object)
        - Observation data: needs different lines of evidence. Was the beetle sitting on the plant or was it feeding?
- Images of interactions: feeding marks or galls can be distinctive. We would like to have a collection of images that illustrate the relationship

**What's most important?:**

- Was the plant just visited, or was there feeding by adults, or was there feeding by larvae?
- What plant part are the larvae feeding on? (problem: larvae are usually not identified or collected. Evidence is often by other means, such as rearing, or finding adult specimen in pupal chambers within the plant)
- Is the relationship characterized by structures like galls or leaf rolls?
- (maybe) What plant part are the adults sitting on?

**Biological assumptions:**

- Interactions between larvae and plants are more relevant than interactions by adults: They are more likely to have evolutionary significance, and the presence of suitable larval hosts is required for reproduction, having implications for conservation, crop protection and species distribution.

### Data structure

The properties could be interlinked as part of an ontology. This would make some properties redundant for some relationships (e.g. [resource for larval feeding] is a subset of [resource in a trophic relationship]). But it's better to store all properties to make the dataset more self-contained.

## List of Biological Relationships

### Format explanation

<!-- Editor note: Use the /// bio-rel shorthand for all tables in this section.
     See Readme.md → bio-rel table syntax for details. -->

```bio-rel
Relationship name | Inverted relationship name
[property 1] [property 2] | [property 3]
Definition of the relationship
```

### First set, focus on lines of evidence

```bio-rel
undefined relationship with | undefined relationship with
Definition: None (no information given)
```

```bio-rel
dubious relationship | dubious relationship
A relationship that seems unlikely, but has been published. Ideally, cite the source that states that the relationship is dubious, otherwise cite the original source.
```

```bio-rel
asserted relationship | asserted relationship
This relationship is to be used if no other information is given, e.g. for catalog entries where plants and insects are associated with each other, without any lines of evidence given. It is assumed that this kind of relationship represents some kind of "common knowledge", but it cannot be verified as no lines of evidence are given. If certainly dubious, use "dubious relationship" instead!
```

```bio-rel
asserted oligophagous relationship with higher taxon | target of asserted oligophagous relationship
Literature will often contain information such as "associated with Lamiaceae". Using this relationship is more accurate than using just the asserted relationship.
```

```bio-rel
feeding observed in the wild on | fed upon in the wild by
[imago] [consumer in a trophic relationship] | [resource in a trophic relationship]
A specimen has been observed feeding on a host in the wild.
```

```bio-rel
feeding observed in experimental setup on | fed upon in experimental setup by
[imago] [consumer in a trophic relationship] | [resource in a trophic relationship]
A specimen has been observed feeding on a plant in an experimental setup.
```

```bio-rel
reared from | yielded by rearing
[larva] [consumer in a trophic relationship] | [resource in a trophic relationship] [resource for larval feeding]
In most cases, a more specific biological relationship can be used, also defining the plant organ.
```

```bio-rel
agricultural pest of | host for agricultural pest
[consumer in a trophic relationship] [agricultural pest] | [resource in a trophic relationship]
It does make sense to have this as a separate category, because of economic importance but also because agricultural literature seems to be erroneous more often than other sources.
```

```bio-rel
visitor of | visited by
[imago] |
An unclear relationship. E.g. a specimen has been collected from a plant, but it is unknown if it was feeding or not. (property imago added, as larvae that are "visiting" a plant would constitute a larval host relationship in almost any case)
```

```bio-rel
flower visitor of | flower visited by
[imago] | [flower]
Separate from "visitor of", as flower visitors may have ecological properties that are distinct from general visitors. A more complex system would define various pollination relationships (e.g. brood-site pollinators). (property imago added, as larvae that are "visiting" a plant would constitute a larval host relationship in almost any case)
```

```bio-rel
collected adults from dead plant matter of | dead plant matter yielded adults of
[imago] [consumer in a saprophagous trophic relationship] | [resource in a saprophagous trophic relationship]
e.g. adult specimen of a Cossonine collected beneath the bark of <em>Pinus</em> sp.
```

```bio-rel
collected larvae from dead plant matter of | dead plant matter yielded larvae of
[larva] [consumer in a saprophagous trophic relationship] | [resource in a saprophagous trophic relationship] [resource for larval feeding]
e.g. larva of a Cossonine collected beneath the bark of <em>Pinus</em> sp.
```

### Second set, focus on biology

```bio-rel
inquiline of | host for inquiline
[inquiline] | [inquiline host]
Inquilinism without defining life stages or plant organs. Can also be used to describe a relationship between weevils and ants, or between <em>Hormops</em> and squirrels. See also "larva is inquiline of", which is more suitable for inquilines in galls.
```

### Third set, focus on larval biology

```bio-rel
larva feeds on | larval host for
[larva] [consumer in a trophic relationship] | [plant, part unspecified] [resource in a trophic relationship] [resource for larval feeding]
This is a relationship that can be used for unspecified larval relationships. The relationship should only be used if evidence for larval feeding is presented by the source! Otherwise, use something like "asserted relationship".
```

```bio-rel
larva is inquiline of | host for inquiline larva
[larva] [inquiline] | [inquiline host]
This will often try to represent tripartite relationships, usually between two insects and a plant. TaxonWorks does not support that directly. I suggest making two entries, one between the inquiline and its insect host (using this relationship), and one with the plant (using another relationship, such as one of the larval galler relationships).
```

```bio-rel
larva in leaf roll on | has leaf roll with larvae of
[larva] [leaf roller] [consumer in trophic relationship] | [leaf] [leaf roller host] [resource in a trophic relationship] [resource for larval feeding]
This relationship is used for the leaf rolls of Attelabidae.
```

### Fourth set, larval development for each plant part

The following relationships have to be realized for all 11 plant anatomical parts, resulting in a total of 33 unique biological relationships. Replace **XXX** with a plant anatomical part from the List of Properties.

```bio-rel
exophagous larva feeds on XXX of | XXX is fed upon by exophagous larva of
[larva] [consumer in trophic relationship] [exophagous] | [XXX] [resource in a trophic relationship] [resource for larval feeding]
Vagrant larvae feeding on XXX (they are not dwelling in the resource). (only use if evidence for larval feeding is given)
```

```bio-rel
endophagous larva feeds in XXX of | XXX is inhabited by endophagous larva of
[larva] [consumer in trophic relationship] [endophagous] | [XXX] [resource in a trophic relationship] [resource for larval feeding]
Larvae are dwelling within XXX (usually boring within the resource). (only use if evidence for larval feeding is given)
```

```bio-rel
larva is galler on XXX of | XXX is gall location for larva of
[larva] [consumer in trophic relationship] [galler] | [XXX] [resource in a trophic relationship] [gall host] [resource for larval feeding]
Larvae are inducing a gall on XXX of the resource. (only use if evidence for larval feeding is given)
```

## Preview: TaxonPages

An example can be seen on TaxonPages:

- [*Adosomus roridus* (weevil, with list of plants)](https://catalog.curculionoidea.org/#/otus/732686/overview)
- [*Achillea millefolium* (plant, with list of weevils)](https://catalog.curculionoidea.org/#/otus/735489/overview)

TaxonPages, which is a static page to display data via the TaxonWorks API, has currently some shortcomings in how it displays Biological relationships:

- No search bar for plants
- Asserted distribution of a biological relationship is not provided (ideas: as text within the table, or on the map for the species distribution in a separate color)
- Citation for the relationship is given as short reference only, without the option to open it to see the full record with clickable links/DOI
- Under certain circumstances, plants can inherit the distribution of their insect associates
