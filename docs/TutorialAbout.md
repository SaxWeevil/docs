This tutorial is following the workflow that is used to move the **[World Catalogue of the Curculionidae: Lixinae: Cleonini](https://weevil.myspecies.info/content/world-catalogue-curculionidae-lixinae-cleonini)** by Massimo Meregalli into TaxonWorks.  

The Cleonini Catalogue was previously published as a website (html), but each genus was also summarized in a PDF file identical to the respective webpage.  
It is an excellent example of a richly annotated catalog, many other catalogs contain fewer citations for the information they provide. However, it would profit from living in a database such as TaxonWorks, where the data is much more manageable, interlinked and filterable.

We see a lot of information that needs to be transferred into TaxonWorks:

 - **Names** for genus, subgenus and species, including synonyms. Synonyms can have a status e.g. as homonym
 - Citation for **original description**, with page number
 - **Images**, usually depicting a type specimen
 - **Original genus** for names that where described in a different genus
 - **Type locality**, sometimes in verbatim ("Steppes des Kirguises")
 - Asserted **distribution**: List of countries/provinces from which the species was recorded, with citation. 
 - **Type seen** by Massimo Meregalli ("!")
 - Verbatim text ("**Remarks**: A lectotype [...]")

All of this is extremely valuable information and easily represented in the data model of TaxonWorks. On top, we will add the following whenever possible:

 - host plants
 - subsequent combinations (combinations between genus and species that where used after the original description but before the one that is currently used), with citation
 - identification keys
 - much more possible: DNA, morphological traits, etc...

## Can I import an existing dataset instead of doing everything by hand?
Yes, definitely! But your dataset needs to be in a structured format. Most existing catalogs are in a verbatim format that is difficult to transform into a structure that can be imported into TaxonWorks. However, one strength of TaxonWorks is that you can export your data in a structured format, making it easier to move it to any other application. Adding data to TaxonWorks is "mobilizing" it for future use.
